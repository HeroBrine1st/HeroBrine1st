ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HeroBrine1st, a random-time enthusiast developer.

I'm interested in self-hosting, privacy and cybersecurity (because there's no privacy without security). I'm not particularly interested in software development, but the world mostly doesn't have software I need. So, my favourite language is Kotlin due to its great expressiveness combined with ease of enforcing forward soundness<sup>[a](articles/2025-10-02-forward-soundness.md)</sup>, together with the best UI library I ever used - Jetpack Compose.
