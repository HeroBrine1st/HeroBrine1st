ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HeroBrine1st, a random-time enthusiast developer.

I'm generally interested in cybersecurity and in self-hosting solutions that allow people to regain their control back (even if partially, like [spotify-dumper](https://github.com/HeroBrine1st/spotify-dumper)). My favourite language is Kotlin due to its great expressiveness combined with ease of enforcing forward soundness (see my articles), together with the best UI library I ever used - Jetpack Compose.

I'm on my slow way to provide the world with good software, where slow is because I like solving actual unsolved problems more than simply developing in the sake of development - and that's why you won't ever see me writing another notes, calendar or TODO application, unless there's oddly specific feature no one implements. For example, spotify-dumper has ability to run without any human interaction and was actually used for automatic "backups" of all my playlists.
